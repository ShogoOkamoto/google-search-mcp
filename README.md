# google-search-mcp
This module is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that utilizes Google Custom Search (CSE) to retrieve information from the internet. By leveraging this MCP, the Large Language Model (LLM) is enabled to perform real-time Web searches. A separate Google Custom Search API key is required for its use.
